These are the Amazon Technical Academy (ATA) agreed upon checkstyle and they should be referenced from each Java package containing code for ATA.
 
 == How to use? ==
 
 1. Make sure the ATACheckstyle package is added to your version-set.
 
 2. Add ATACheckstyle to the build dependencies in your Config. (Note that these rules do not work with Checkstyle 3.3.)
 
     ...
     build-tools = {
         1.0 = {
             ATACheckstyle = 1.1;
             HappierTrails = 3.4;
             ...
         };
     };
     ...
 
 3. Refer to the appropriate checkstyle definition file in your build.xml. As always, these lines go with other Happier-Trails overrides, so after importing happytrails.xml and before importing happier-trails.xml.
 
     <property name="checkstyle.configuration.file" value="${bp:[ATACheckstyle]pkg.src}/configuration/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml"/>
     <property name="checkstyle.suppression.filter" value="${bp:[ATACheckstyle]pkg.src}/configuration/checkstyle/suppressions.xml"/>
